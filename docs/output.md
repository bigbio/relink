# bigbio/relink: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

1. [File Conversion](#file-conversion) - Convert RAW files to MGF format
2. [Linear Search](#linear-search) - Run xiSEARCH linear search for mass recalibration
3. [Mass Recalibration](#mass-recalibration) - Calculate mass errors and recalibrate MGF files
4. [Crosslinking Search](#crosslinking-search) - Run xiSEARCH crosslinking search
5. [FDR Correction](#fdr-correction) - FDR correction using xiFDR
6. [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
7. [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### File Conversion

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `file_conversion/`
  - `*.mgf`: MGF format peak list files converted from RAW files

</details>

RAW files are converted to MGF format using ThermoRawFileParser for downstream analysis.

### Linear Search

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `linear_search/`
  - `*_linear.csv`: Linear search results from xiSEARCH
  - `*_peaks.csv`: Peak annotation files

</details>

xiSEARCH linear peptide search is used to identify peptides for mass recalibration.

### Mass Recalibration

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mass_recalibration/`
  - `*_recalibrated.mgf`: Recalibrated MGF files
  - `*_mass_error.png`: Mass error distribution plots (if enabled)

</details>

Mass errors are calculated from linear search results and used to recalibrate the MGF peak lists.

### Crosslinking Search

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `crosslinking_search/`
  - `*_crosslink.csv`: Crosslinking search results

</details>

xiSEARCH crosslinking search identifies crosslinked peptide pairs.

### FDR Correction

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fdr/`
  - `*_fdr.csv`: FDR-corrected results
  - `*_links.csv`: Identified crosslinks

</details>

xiFDR is used to perform FDR correction on crosslinking search results.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.html`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` - these are generated if the `--email` or `--email_on_fail` parameter is used.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
